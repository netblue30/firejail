# Firejail

Firejail is a SUID sandbox program that reduces the risk of security breaches by restricting
the running environment of untrusted applications using Linux namespaces, seccomp-bpf
and Linux capabilities. It allows a process and all its descendants to have their own private
view of the globally shared kernel resources, such as the network stack, process table, mount table.
Firejail can work in a SELinux or AppArmor environment, and it is integrated with Linux Control Groups.

Written in C with virtually no dependencies, the software runs on any Linux computer with a 3.x kernel
version or newer. It can sandbox any type of processes: servers, graphical applications, and even
user login sessions. The software includes sandbox profiles for a number of more common Linux programs,
such as Mozilla Firefox, Chromium, VLC, Transmission etc.

The sandbox is lightweight, the overhead is low. There are no complicated configuration files to edit,
no socket connections open, no daemons running in the background. All security features are
implemented directly in Linux kernel and available on any Linux computer. To start the sandbox,
prefix your command with “firejail”:

`````
$ firejail firefox            # starting Mozilla Firefox
$ firejail transmission-gtk   # starting Transmission BitTorrent 
$ firejail vlc                # starting VideoLAN Client
$ sudo firejail /etc/init.d/nginx start
`````

# Current development version: 0.9.43

## X11 development
`````
       --x11=none
              Blacklist /tmp/.X11-unix directory, ${HOME}/.Xauthority and  the
              file  specified  in  ${XAUTHORITY} environment variable.  Remove
              DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY environment variables.  Stop  with  error
              message if X11 abstract socket will be accessible in jail.

      --x11=xorg
              Sandbox the application using the untrusted mode implemented  by
              X11  security  extension.   The  extension  is available in Xorg
              package and it is installed by default on most  Linux  distribu‐
              tions.  It  provides support for a simple trusted/untrusted con‐
              nection model. Untrusted clients are restricted in certain  ways
              to  prevent  them from reading window contents of other clients,
              stealing input events, etc.

              The untrusted mode has several limitations.  A  lot  of  regular
              programs   assume  they are a trusted X11 clients and will crash
              or lock up when run in  untrusted  mode.  Chromium  browser  and
              xterm are two examples.  Firefox and transmission-gtk seem to be
              working fine.  A network namespace  is  not  required  for  this
              option.

              Example:
              $ firejail --x11=xorg firefox
`````

## Other command line options
`````
      --put=name|pid src-filename dest-filename
              Put src-filename in sandbox container.  The container is specified by name or PID.

       --allusers
              All user home directories are visible inside the sandbox. By default, only current user home
              directory is visible.

              Example:
              $ firejail --allusers

       --join-or-start=name
              Join the sandbox identified by name or start a new one.  Same as "firejail  --join=name"  if
              sandbox with specified name exists, otherwise same as "firejail --name=name ..."
              Note that in contrary to other join options there is respective profile option.

      --no3d Disable 3D hardware acceleration.

              Example:
              $ firejail --no3d firefox

      --veth-name=name
              Use this name for the interface  connected  to  the  bridge  for
              --net=bridge_interface commands, instead of the default one.

              Example:
              $ firejail --net=br0 --veth-name=if0
