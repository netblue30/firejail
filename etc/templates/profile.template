# Firejail profile for PROGRAM_NAME
# Description: DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM
# This file is overwritten after every install/update
# --- CUT HERE ---
# This is a generic template to help you create profiles.
# PRs welcome at https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/.
#
# Rules to follow:
#  - lines with one # are often used in profiles
#  - lines with two ## are only needed in special situations
#  - make the profile as restrictive as possible while still keeping the program useful
#    (e.g. a program that is unable to save user's work is considered bad practice)
#  - dedicate ample time (based on the complexity of the application) to profile testing before
#    submitting a pull request
#  - keep the sections structure, use a single empty line as separator
#  - entries within sections are alphabetically sorted
#  - consider putting binary into src/firecfg/firecfg.config (keep list sorted) but beware
#    to not do this for essential utilities as this may *break* your OS! (related discussion:
#    https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/issues/2507)
#  - remove this comment section and any generic comment past 'Persistent global definitions'

# It is common practice to add files/dirs containing program-specific configuration
# (often ${HOME}/PROGRAMNAME or ${HOME}/.config/PROGRAMNAME) into disable-programs.inc
# (keep list sorted) and then disable blacklisting below.
# One way to retrieve the files a program uses is:
#  - launch binary with --private naming a sandbox
#      `firejail --name=test --ignore=private-bin [--profile=PROFILE] --private BINARY`
#  - work with the program, make some configuration changes and save them, open new documents,
#    install plugins if they exists, etc.
#  - join the sandbox with bash:
#      `firejail --join=test bash`
#  - look what has changed and use that information to populate blacklist and whitelist sections
#      `ls -aR`

# Since 0.9.63 also a more granular control of dbus is supported.
# To get the dbus-addresses an application needs access to you can
# check with flatpak (when the application is distriputed that way):
#    flatpak remote-info --show-metadata flathub <APP-ID>
# Notes:
#  - flatpak implicitly allows an app to own <APP-ID> on the session bus
#  - Some features like native notifications are implemented as portal too.
#  - In order to make dconf work (when used by the app) you need to allow
#    'ca.desrt.dconf' even when not allowed by flatpak.
# Notes and policies about addresses can be found at
# <https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/wiki/Restrict-D-Bus>
