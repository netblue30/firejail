# Firejail profile for I2P
# Description: A distributed anonymous network
# This file is overwritten after every install/update
# Persistent local customizations
include i2prouter.local
# Persistent global definitions
include globals.local

# Notice: default browser will most likely not be able to automatically open, due to sandbox.
# Auto-opening default browser can be disabled in the I2P router console.
# This profile will not currently work with any Arch User Repository I2P packages,
# use the distro-independent official I2P java installer instead.

# Only needed when i2prouter binary resides in home directory (official I2P java installer does so).
