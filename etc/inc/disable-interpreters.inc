# rxvt needs Perl modules, thus does not work. In particular, blacklisting
# it is needed so that Firefox can run applications with Terminal=true in
# their .desktop file (depending on what is installed). The reason is that
# this is done via glib, which currently uses a hardcoded list of terminal
# emulators:
#   https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/issues/338
# And in this list, rxvt comes before xterm.
