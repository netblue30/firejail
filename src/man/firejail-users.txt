.SH NAME
firejail.users \- Firejail user access database

.SH DESCRIPTION
/etc/firejail/firejail.users lists the users allowed to run firejail SUID executable.
If the file is not present in the system, all users are allowed to use the sandbox.
root user is allowed by default. Other system users (users with an ID below UID_MIN value
defined in /etc/login.defs, typically 1000) are not allowed to start the sandbox.

If the user is not allowed to start the sandbox, Firejail will attempt to run the
program without sandboxing it.

Example:

	$ cat /etc/firejail/firejail.users
.br
	dustin
.br
	lucas
.br
	mike
.br
	eleven

Use a text editor to add or remove users from the list. You can also use firecfg \-\-add-users
command. Example:

	$ sudo firecfg --add-users dustin lucas mike eleven

By default, running firecfg creates the file and adds the current user to the list. Example:

	$ sudo firecfg

See \fBman 1 firecfg\fR for details.
