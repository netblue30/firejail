# Firejail profile for Node.js
# Description: Asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime
# This file is overwritten after every install/update
# Persistent local customizations
include nodejs-common.local
# Persistent global definitions
# added by caller profile
#include globals.local

# Note: gulp, node-gyp, npm, npx, pnpm, pnpx, semver and yarn are all node scripts
# using the `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang. By sandboxing node the full
# node.js stack will be firejailed. The only exception is nvm, which is implemented
# as a sourced shell function, not an executable binary. Hence it is not
# directly firejailable. You can work around this by sandboxing the programs
# used by nvm: curl, sha256sum, tar and wget. We have comments in these
# profiles on how to enable nvm support via local overrides.
