Welcome to firejail, and thank you for your interest in contributing!

# Opening an issue:
We welcome issues, whether to ask a question, provide information, request a new profile or
feature, or to report a suspected bug or problem.

If you want to request a program profile that we don't already have, please add a comment in
our [dedicated issue](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/issues/1139).

When submitting a bug report, please provide the following information so that
we can handle the report more easily:
 - firejail version. If you're not sure, open a terminal and type `firejail --version`.
 - Linux distribution (so that we can try to reproduce it, if necessary).
 - If you know that the problem did not exist in an earlier version of firejail, please mention it.
 - If you are reporting that a program does not work with firejail, please also run firejail with
 the `--noprofile` argument.
 For example, if `firejail firefox` does not work, please also run `firejail --noprofile firefox` and
 let us know if it runs correctly or not.
 - You may also try disabling various options provided in `/etc/firejail/<ProgramName.profile>` until you find out which one causes problems. It will significantly help to find solution for your issue.

Please note: if you are running Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or another related
distribution and you installed firejail from your distro's repositories, please
ensure that **both** of the following were installed:
`firejail` and `firejail-profiles`. A common source of issues is that
firejail-profiles was not installed when installing firejail.

We take security bugs very seriously. If you believe you have found one, please report it by
emailing us at netblue30@protonmail.com

# Opening an pull request:
Pull requests with enhancements, bugfixes or new profiles are very welcome.

If you want to write a new profile, the easiest way to do this is to use the
[profile template](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/blob/master/etc/templates/profile.template).
If you have already written a profile, please make sure it follows the rules described in the template.
