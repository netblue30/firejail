# Firejail profile for PROGRAM_NAME
# Description: DESCRIPTION
# This file is overwritten after every install/update
# --- CUT HERE ---
# This is a generic template to help you with creation of profiles
# for new programs. PRs welcome at https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/
#
# Rules to follow:
#  - lines with one # are often used in profiles
#  - lines with two ## are only needed in special situations
#  - make the profile as restrictive as possible while still keeping the program useful
#    (e. g. a program that is unable to save user's work is considered a bad practice)
#  - dedicate some time (based on how complex the application is) to profile testing before raising
#    a pull request
#  - keep the sections structure, use a single empty line as a separator
#  - entries within sections are alphabetically sorted
#  - consider putting binary into src/firecfg/firecfg.config (keep list sorted) but beware
#    to not do this for essential utilities as this may *break* your OS! (related discussion:
#    https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/issues/2507)
#  - remove this comment section and any generic comment past 'Persistent global definitions'

##blacklist PATH

# It is common practice to add files/dirs containing program-specific configuration
# (often ${HOME}/PROGRAMNAME or ${HOME}/.config/PROGRAMNAME) into disable-programs.inc
# (keep list sorted) and then disable blacklisting below.
# One way to retrieve the files a program uses is:
#  - launch binary with --private naming a sandbox
#      `firejail --name=test --ignore=private-bin [--profile=PROFILE] --private BINARY`
#  - work with the program, do some configuration changes and save them, open new documents,
#    install plugins if they exists, etc
#  - join the sandbox with bash:
#      `firejail --join=test bash`
#  - look what has changed and use that information to populate blacklist and whitelist sections
#      `ls -aR`
#noblacklist PATH

# Allow python (blacklisted by disable-interpreters.inc)
#noblacklist ${PATH}/python2*
#noblacklist ${PATH}/python3*
#noblacklist /usr/lib/python2*
#noblacklist /usr/lib/python3*
#noblacklist /usr/local/lib/python2*
#noblacklist /usr/local/lib/python3*

# Allow perl (blacklisted by disable-interpreters.inc)
#noblacklist ${PATH}/cpan*
#noblacklist ${PATH}/core_perl
#noblacklist ${PATH}/perl
#noblacklist /usr/lib/perl*
#noblacklist /usr/share/perl*

# This section often mirrors noblacklist section above. The idea is
# that if a user feels too restricted (he's unable to save files into
# home directory for instance) he/she may disable whitelist (nowhitelist)
# in PROFILE.local but still be protected by BLACKLISTS section
# (further explanation at https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/issues/1569)
