.SH NAME
profile \- Security profile file syntax for Firejail

.SH USAGE
.TP
firejail \-\-profile=filename.profile
.RE
firejail \-\-profile=profile_name

.SH DESCRIPTION
Several command line options can be passed to the program using
profile files. Firejail chooses the profile file as follows:

\fB1.\fR If a profile file is provided by the user with \-\-profile option, the profile file is loaded. If a profile name is given, it is searched for first in the ~/.config/firejail directory and if not found then in  /etc/firejail directory. Profile names do not include the .profile suffix.
Example:
.PP
.RS
$ firejail --profile=/home/netblue/icecat.profile icecat
.br
Reading profile /home/netblue/icecat.profile
.br
[...]
.RE

.PP
.RS
$ firejail --profile=icecat icecat-wrapper.sh
.br
Reading profile /etc/firejail/icecat.profile
.br
[...]
.RE

\fB2.\fR If a profile file with the same name as the application is present in ~/.config/firejail directory or
in /etc/firejail, the profile is loaded. ~/.config/firejail takes precedence over /etc/firejail. Example:
.PP
.RS
$ firejail icecat
.br
Command name #icecat#
.br
Found icecat profile in /home/netblue/.config/firejail directory
.br
Reading profile /home/netblue/.config/firejail/icecat.profile
.br
[...]
.RE

\fB3.\fR Use a default.profile file if the sandbox
is started by a regular user, or a server.profile file if the sandbox
is started by root. Firejail looks for these files in ~/.config/firejail directory, followed by /etc/firejail directory.
To disable default profile loading, use --noprofile command option. Example:
.PP
.RS
$ firejail
.br
Reading profile /etc/firejail/default.profile
.br
Parent pid 8553, child pid 8554
.br
Child process initialized
.br
[...]
.br

.br
$ firejail \-\-noprofile
.br
Parent pid 8553, child pid 8554
.br
Child process initialized
.br
[...]
.RE

.SH Templates
In /usr/share/doc/firejail there are two templates to write new profiles.
.RS
profile.template - for regular profiles
.br
redirect_alias-profile.template - for aliasing/redirecting profiles
.RE


.SH Scripting
Scripting commands:

.TP
\fBFile and directory names
File and directory names containing spaces are supported. The space character ' ' should not be escaped.

Example: "blacklist ~/My Virtual Machines"

.TP
\fB# this is a comment

.TP
\fB?CONDITIONAL: profile line
Conditionally add profile line.

Example: "?HAS_APPIMAGE: whitelist ${HOME}/special/appimage/dir"

This example will load the whitelist profile line only if the \-\-appimage option has been specified on the command line.

Currently the only conditionals supported this way are HAS_APPIMAGE, HAS_NET, HAS_NODBUS, HAS_NOSOUND and HAS_X11. The conditionals BROWSER_DISABLE_U2F and BROWSER_ALLOW_DRM
can be enabled or disabled globally in Firejail's configuration file.

The profile line may be any profile line that you would normally use in a profile \fBexcept\fR for "quiet" and "include" lines.

.TP
\fBinclude other.profile
Include other.profile file.

Example: "include /etc/firejail/disable-common.inc"

The file name can be prefixed with a macro such as ${HOME} or ${CFG}.
${HOME} is expanded as user home directory, and ${CFG} is expanded as
Firejail system configuration directory - in most cases /etc/firejail or
/usr/local/etc/firejail.

Example: "include ${HOME}/myprofiles/profile1" will load "~/myprofiles/profile1" file.

Example: "include ${CFG}/firefox.profile" will load "/etc/firejail/firefox.profile" file.

The file name may also be just the name without the leading directory components.  In this case, first the user config directory (${HOME}/.config/firejail) is searched for the file name and if not found then the system configuration directory is search for the file name.  Note: Unlike the \-\-profile option which takes a profile name without the '.profile' suffix, include must be given the full file name.

Example: "include firefox.profile" will load "${HOME}/.config/firejail/firefox.profile" file and if it does not exist "${CFG}/firefox.profile" will be loaded.

System configuration files in ${CFG} are overwritten during software installation.
Persistent configuration at system level is handled in ".local" files. For every
profile file in ${CFG} directory, the user can create a corresponding .local file
storing modifications to the persistent configuration. Persistent .local files
are included at the start of regular profile files.

.TP
\fBnoblacklist file_name
If the file name matches file_name, the file will not be blacklisted in any blacklist commands that follow.

Example: "noblacklist ${HOME}/.mozilla"

.TP
\fBnowhitelist file_name
If the file name matches file_name, the file will not be whitelisted in any whitelist commands that follow.

Example: "nowhitelist ~/.config"

.TP
\fBignore
Ignore command.

Example: "ignore seccomp"
#ifdef HAVE_NETWORK
.br
Example: "ignore net eth0"
#endif
.TP
\fBquiet
Disable Firejail's output. This should be the first uncommented command in the profile file.

Example: "quiet"

.SH Filesystem
These profile entries define a chroot filesystem built on top of the existing
host filesystem. Each line describes a file/directory that is inaccessible
(\fBblacklist\fR), a read-only file or directory (\fBread-only\fR),
a tmpfs mounted on top of an existing directory (\fBtmpfs\fR),
or mount-bind a directory or file on top of another directory or file (\fBbind\fR).
Use \fBprivate\fR to set private mode.  File globbing is supported, and PATH and
HOME directories are searched, see the \fBfirejail\f(1) \fBFILE GLOBBING\fR section
for more details.
Examples:
.TP
\fBblacklist file_or_directory
Blacklist directory or file. Examples:
.br

.br
blacklist /usr/bin
.br
blacklist /usr/bin/gcc*
.br
blacklist ${PATH}/ifconfig
.br
blacklist ${HOME}/.ssh

.TP
\fBblacklist-nolog file_or_directory
When --tracelog flag is set, blacklisting generates syslog messages if the sandbox tries to access the file or directory.
blacklist-nolog command disables syslog messages for this particular file or directory. Examples:
.br

.br
blacklist-nolog /usr/bin
.br
blacklist-nolog /usr/bin/gcc*

.TP
\fBbind directory1,directory2
Mount-bind directory1 on top of directory2. This option is only available when running as root.
.TP
\fBbind file1,file2
Mount-bind file1 on top of file2. This option is only available when running as root.
.TP
\fBdisable-mnt
Disable /mnt, /media, /run/mount and /run/media access.
.TP
\fBkeep-dev-shm
/dev/shm directory is untouched (even with private-dev).
.TP
\fBkeep-var-tmp
/var/tmp directory is untouched.
.TP
\fBmkdir directory
Create a directory in user home, under /tmp, or under /run/user/<UID> before the sandbox is started.
The directory is created if it doesn't already exist.
.br

.br
Use this command for whitelisted directories you need to preserve
when the sandbox is closed. Without it, the application will create the directory, and the directory
will be deleted when the sandbox is closed. Subdirectories are recursively created. Example from
firefox profile:
.br

.br
mkdir ~/.mozilla
.br
whitelist ~/.mozilla
.br
mkdir ~/.cache/mozilla/firefox
.br
whitelist ~/.cache/mozilla/firefox
.br

.br
For files in /run/user/<PID> use ${RUNUSER} macro:
.br

.br
mkdir ${RUNUSER}/firejail-testing
.TP
\fBmkfile file
Similar to mkdir, this command creates an empty file in user home, or /tmp, or under /run/user/<UID>
before the sandbox is started. The file is created if it doesn't already exist.

xephyr-screen 640x480
.br
x11 xephyr
#endif
#ifdef HAVE_DBUSPROXY
.SH DBus filtering

Access to the session and system DBus UNIX sockets can be allowed, filtered or
disabled. To disable the abstract sockets (and force applications to use the
filtered UNIX socket) you would need to request a new network namespace using
\-\-net command. Another option is to remove unix from the \-\-protocol set.
.br

.br
Filtering requires installing the xdg-dbus-proxy utility. Filter rules can be
specified for well-known DBus names, but they are also propagated to the owning
unique name, too. The permissions are "sticky" and are kept even if the
corresponding well-known name is released (however, applications rarely release
well-known names in practice). Names may have a .* suffix to match all names
underneath them, including themselves (e.g. "foo.bar.*" matches "foo.bar",
"foo.bar.baz" and "foo.bar.baz.quux", but not "foobar"). For more information,
see xdg-dbus-proxy(1).

\fBnet tap_interface
Enable a new network namespace and connect it
to this ethernet tap interface using the standard Linux macvlan
driver.  If the tap interface is not configured, the sandbox
will not try to configure the interface inside the sandbox.
Please use ip, netmask and defaultgw to specify the configuration.

.TP
\fBnetfilter
If a new network namespace is created, enabled default network filter.

.TP
\fBnetfilter filename
If a new network namespace is created, enabled the network filter in filename.


.TP
\fBnetmask address
Use this option when you want to assign an IP address in a new namespace and
the parent interface specified by --net is not configured. An IP address and
a default gateway address also have to be added.

.TP
\fBnetns namespace
Run the program in a named, persistent network namespace. These can
be created and configured using "ip netns".

.TP
\fBveth-name name
Use this name for the interface connected to the bridge for --net=bridge_interface commands,
instead of the default one.

.TP
\fBjoin-or-start sandboxname
Join the sandbox identified by name or start a new one.
Same as "firejail --join=sandboxname" command if sandbox with specified name exists, otherwise same as "name sandboxname".
