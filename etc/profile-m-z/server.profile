# Generic Firejail profile for servers started as root
#
# This profile is used as a default when starting the sandbox as root.
# Example:
#
#       $ sudo firejail
#       [sudo] password for netblue:
#       Reading profile /etc/firejail/server.profile
#       Reading profile /etc/firejail/disable-common.inc
#       Reading profile /etc/firejail/disable-passwdmgr.inc
#       Reading profile /etc/firejail/disable-programs.inc
#
#       ** Note: you can use --noprofile to disable server.profile **
#
#       Parent pid 5347, child pid 5348
#       The new log directory is /proc/5348/root/var/log
#       Child process initialized in 64.43 ms
#       root@debian:~#
#
# Customize the profile as usual. Examples: unbound.profile, fdns.profile.
# All the rules for regular user profiles apply with the exception of
# /usr/local/bin symlink redirection and firecfg tool. The redirection is disabled
# by default for root user.
