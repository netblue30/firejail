.SH NAME
profile \- Security profile file syntax, and information about building new application profiles.

.SH SYNOPSIS

Using a specific profile:
.PP
.RS
.TP
\fBfirejail \-\-profile=filename.profile
.br

.br
Example:
.br
$ firejail --appimage --profile=/etc/firejail/kdenlive.profile kdenlive.appimage
.br

.br
.TP
\fBfirejail \-\-profile=profile_name
.br

.br
Example:
.br
$ firejail --appimage --profile=kdenlive kdenlive.appimage
.br

.RE
.PP



Building a profile manually:
.PP
.RS
Start with the template in /usr/share/doc/firejail/profile.template and modify it in a text editor.
To integrate the program in your desktop environment copy the profile file in ~/.config/firejail
directory and run "sudo firecfg".
.RE
.PP

Aliases and redirections:
.PP
.RS
In some cases the same profile can be used for several applications.
One such example is LibreOffice.
Build a regular profile for the main application, and for the rest use
/usr/share/doc/firejail/redirect_alias-profile.template.
.RE
.PP

Running the profile builder:
.PP
.RS
.TP
\fBfirejail \-\-build=appname.profile appname
.br

.br
Example:
.br
$ firejail --build=blobby.profile blobby
.br

.br
Run the program in "firejail \-\-build" and try to exercise as many program features as possible.
The profile is extracted and saved in the current directory. Open it in a text editor and add or remove
sandboxing options as necessary. Test again after modifying the profile. To integrate the program
in your desktop environment copy the profile file in ~/.config/firejail directory and run "sudo firecfg".

.SH DESCRIPTION
Several command line options can be passed to the program using
profile files. Firejail chooses the profile file as follows:

\fB1.\fR If a profile file is provided by the user with \-\-profile option, the profile file is loaded. If a profile name is given, it is searched for first in the ~/.config/firejail directory and if not found then in /etc/firejail directory. Profile names do not include the .profile suffix.
Example:
.PP
.RS
$ firejail --profile=/home/netblue/icecat.profile icecat
.br
Reading profile /home/netblue/icecat.profile
.br
[...]
.RE

.PP
.RS
$ firejail --profile=icecat icecat-wrapper.sh
.br
Reading profile /etc/firejail/icecat.profile
.br
[...]
.RE

\fB2.\fR If a profile file with the same name as the application is present in ~/.config/firejail directory or
in /etc/firejail, the profile is loaded. ~/.config/firejail takes precedence over /etc/firejail. Example:
.PP
.RS
$ firejail icecat
.br
Command name #icecat#
.br
Found icecat profile in /home/netblue/.config/firejail directory
.br
Reading profile /home/netblue/.config/firejail/icecat.profile
.br
[...]
.RE

\fB3.\fR Use a default.profile file if the sandbox
is started by a regular user, or a server.profile file if the sandbox
is started by root. Firejail looks for these files in ~/.config/firejail directory, followed by /etc/firejail directory.
To disable default profile loading, use --noprofile command option. Example:
.PP
.RS
$ firejail
.br
Reading profile /etc/firejail/default.profile
.br
Parent pid 8553, child pid 8554
.br
Child process initialized
.br
[...]
.br

.br
$ firejail \-\-noprofile
.br
Parent pid 8553, child pid 8554
.br
Child process initialized
.br
[...]
.RE

.SH Templates
In /usr/share/doc/firejail there are two templates to write new profiles.
.RS
profile.template - for regular profiles
.br
redirect_alias-profile.template - for aliasing/redirecting profiles
.RE


.SH Scripting
Scripting commands:

.TP
\fBFile and directory names
File and directory names containing spaces are supported. The space character ' ' should not be escaped.

Example: "blacklist ~/My Virtual Machines"

.TP
\fB# this is a comment
Example:

# disable networking
.br
net none # this command creates an empty network namespace

.TP
\fB?CONDITIONAL: profile line
Conditionally add profile line.

Example: "?HAS_APPIMAGE: whitelist ${HOME}/special/appimage/dir"

This example will load the whitelist profile line only if the \-\-appimage option has been specified on the command line.

Currently the only conditionals supported this way are HAS_APPIMAGE, HAS_NET, HAS_NODBUS, HAS_NOSOUND, HAS_PRIVATE and HAS_X11. The conditionals ALLOW_TRAY, BROWSER_DISABLE_U2F and BROWSER_ALLOW_DRM
can be enabled or disabled globally in Firejail's configuration file.

The profile line may be any profile line that you would normally use in a profile \fBexcept\fR for "quiet" and "include" lines.

Note: When using one or more conditionals and \fB--profile\fR, it is
recommended that the relevant option(s) (such as \fB--appimage\fR) be specified
before \fB--profile\fR, so that their respective conditional(s) (such as
\fB?HAS_APPIMAGE\fR) inside of the profile evaluate to true.

.TP
\fBinclude other.profile
Include other.profile file.

Example: "include /etc/firejail/disable-common.inc"

The file name can be prefixed with a macro such as ${HOME} or ${CFG}.
${HOME} is expanded as user home directory, and ${CFG} is expanded as
Firejail system configuration directory - in most cases /etc/firejail or
/usr/local/etc/firejail.

Example: "include ${HOME}/myprofiles/profile1" will load "~/myprofiles/profile1" file.

Example: "include ${CFG}/firefox.profile" will load "/etc/firejail/firefox.profile" file.

The file name may also be just the name without the leading directory components.  In this case, first the user config directory (${HOME}/.config/firejail) is searched for the file name and if not found then the system configuration directory is search for the file name.  Note: Unlike the \-\-profile option which takes a profile name without the '.profile' suffix, include must be given the full file name.

Example: "include firefox.profile" will load "${HOME}/.config/firejail/firefox.profile" file and if it does not exist "${CFG}/firefox.profile" will be loaded.

System configuration files in ${CFG} are overwritten during software installation.
Persistent configuration at system level is handled in ".local" files. For every
profile file in ${CFG} directory, the user can create a corresponding .local file
storing modifications to the persistent configuration. Persistent .local files
are included at the start of regular profile files.

.TP
\fBnoblacklist file_name
If the file name matches file_name, the file will not be blacklisted in any blacklist commands that follow.

Example: "noblacklist ${HOME}/.mozilla"

.TP
\fBnowhitelist file_name
If the file name matches file_name, the file will not be whitelisted in any whitelist commands that follow.

Example: "nowhitelist ~/.config"

.TP
\fBignore
Ignore command.

Example: "ignore seccomp"
#ifdef HAVE_NETWORK
.br
Example: "ignore net eth0"
#endif
.TP
\fBquiet
Disable Firejail's output. This should be the first uncommented command in the profile file.

Example: "quiet"

.SH Filesystem
These profile entries define a chroot filesystem built on top of the existing
host filesystem. Each line describes a file/directory that is inaccessible
(\fBblacklist\fR), a read-only file or directory (\fBread-only\fR),
a tmpfs mounted on top of an existing directory (\fBtmpfs\fR),
or mount-bind a directory or file on top of another directory or file (\fBbind\fR).
Use \fBprivate\fR to set private mode.  File globbing is supported, and PATH and
HOME directories are searched, see the \fBfirejail\f(1) \fBFILE GLOBBING\fR section
for more details.
Examples:
.TP
\fBblacklist file_or_directory
Blacklist directory or file. Examples:
.br

.br
blacklist /usr/bin
.br
blacklist /usr/bin/gcc*
.br
blacklist ${PATH}/ifconfig
.br
blacklist ${HOME}/.ssh

.TP
\fBblacklist-nolog file_or_directory
When --tracelog flag is set, blacklisting generates syslog messages if the sandbox tries to access the file or directory.
blacklist-nolog command disables syslog messages for this particular file or directory. Examples:
.br

.br
blacklist-nolog /usr/bin
.br
blacklist-nolog /usr/bin/gcc*

.TP
\fBbind directory1,directory2
Mount-bind directory1 on top of directory2. This option is only available when running as root.
.TP
\fBbind file1,file2
Mount-bind file1 on top of file2. This option is only available when running as root.
.TP
\fBdisable-mnt
Disable /mnt, /media, /run/mount and /run/media access.
.TP
\fBkeep-config-pulse
Disable automatic ~/.config/pulse init, for complex setups such as remote
pulse servers or non-standard socket paths.
.TP
\fBkeep-dev-shm
/dev/shm directory is untouched (even with private-dev).
.TP
\fBkeep-shell-rc
Do not copy shell rc files (such as ~/.bashrc and ~/.zshrc) from /etc/skel.
.TP
\fBkeep-var-tmp
/var/tmp directory is untouched.
.TP
\fBmkdir directory
Create a directory in user home, under /tmp, or under /run/user/<UID> before the sandbox is started.
The directory is created if it doesn't already exist.
.br

.br
Use this command for whitelisted directories you need to preserve
when the sandbox is closed. Without it, the application will create the directory, and the directory
will be deleted when the sandbox is closed. Subdirectories are recursively created. Example from
firefox profile:
.br

.br
mkdir ~/.mozilla
.br
whitelist ~/.mozilla
.br
mkdir ~/.cache/mozilla/firefox
.br
whitelist ~/.cache/mozilla/firefox
.br

.br
For files in /run/user/<PID> use ${RUNUSER} macro:
.br

.br
mkdir ${RUNUSER}/firejail-testing
.TP
\fBmkfile file
Similar to mkdir, this command creates an empty file in user home, or /tmp, or under /run/user/<UID>
before the sandbox is started. The file is created if it doesn't already exist.
.TP
\fBnoexec file_or_directory
Remount the file or the directory noexec, nodev and nosuid.
#ifdef HAVE_OVERLAYFS
.TP
\fBoverlay
Mount a filesystem overlay on top of the current filesystem.
The overlay is stored in $HOME/.firejail/<PID> directory.
.TP
\fBoverlay-named name
Mount a filesystem overlay on top of the current filesystem.
The overlay is stored in $HOME/.firejail/name directory.
.TP
\fBoverlay-tmpfs
Mount a filesystem overlay on top of the current filesystem.
All filesystem modifications are discarded when the sandbox is closed.
#endif
.TP
\fBprivate
Mount new /root and /home/user directories in temporary
filesystems. All modifications are discarded when the sandbox is
closed.
.TP
\fBprivate directory
Use directory as user home.
--private and --private=directory cannot be used together.
.br

.br
Bug: Even with this enabled, some commands (such as mkdir, mkfile and
private-cache) will still operate on the original home directory.
Workaround: Disable the incompatible commands, such as by using "ignore mkdir"
and "ignore mkfile".

#endif
#ifdef HAVE_DBUSPROXY
.SH DBus filtering

Access to the session and system DBus UNIX sockets can be allowed, filtered or
disabled. To disable the abstract sockets (and force applications to use the
filtered UNIX socket) you would need to request a new network namespace using
\-\-net command. Another option is to remove unix from the \-\-protocol set.
.br

.br
Filtering requires installing the xdg-dbus-proxy utility. Filter rules can be
specified for well-known DBus names, but they are also propagated to the owning
unique name, too. The permissions are "sticky" and are kept even if the
corresponding well-known name is released (however, applications rarely release
well-known names in practice). Names may have a .* suffix to match all names
underneath them, including themselves (e.g. "foo.bar.*" matches "foo.bar",
"foo.bar.baz" and "foo.bar.baz.quux", but not "foobar"). For more information,
see xdg-dbus-proxy(1).

#ifdef HAVE_NETWORK
.SH Networking
Networking features available in profile files.

.TP
\fBdefaultgw address
Use this address as default gateway in the new network namespace.

.TP
\fBdns address
Set a DNS server for the sandbox. Up to three DNS servers can be defined.

.TP
\fBhostname name
Set a hostname for the sandbox.

.TP
\fBhosts-file file
Use file as /etc/hosts.

.TP
\fBip address
Assign IP addresses to the last network interface defined by a net command. A
default gateway is assigned by default.
.br

.br
Example:
.br
net eth0
.br
ip 10.10.20.56

.TP
\fBip none
No IP address and no default gateway are configured for the last interface
defined by a net command. Use this option
in case you intend to start an external DHCP client in the sandbox.
.br

.br
Example:
.br
net eth0
.br
ip none

.TP
\fBip dhcp
Acquire an IP address and default gateway for the last interface defined by a
net command, as well as set the DNS servers according to the DHCP response.
This command requires the ISC dhclient DHCP client to be installed and will start
it automatically inside the sandbox.
.br

.br
Example:
.br
net br0
.br
ip dhcp
.br

.br
This command should not be used in conjunction with the dns command if the
DHCP server is set to configure DNS servers for the clients, because the
manually specified DNS servers will be overwritten.

.br
The DHCP client will NOT release the DHCP lease when the sandbox terminates.
If your DHCP server requires leases to be explicitly released, consider running
a DHCP client and releasing the lease manually in conjunction with the
net none command.

.TP
\fBip6 address
Assign IPv6 addresses to the last network interface defined by a net command.
.br

.br
Example:
.br
net eth0
.br
ip6 2001:0db8:0:f101::1/64

.TP
\fBip6 dhcp
Acquire an IPv6 address and default gateway for the last interface defined by a
net command, as well as set the DNS servers according to the DHCP response.
This command requires the ISC dhclient DHCP client to be installed and will start
it automatically inside the sandbox.
.br

.br
Example:
.br
net br0
.br
ip6 dhcp
.br

.br
This command should not be used in conjunction with the dns command if the
DHCP server is set to configure DNS servers for the clients, because the
manually specified DNS servers will be overwritten.

.br
The DHCP client will NOT release the DHCP lease when the sandbox terminates.
If your DHCP server requires leases to be explicitly released, consider running
a DHCP client and releasing the lease manually.

.TP
\fBiprange address,address
Assign an IP address in the provided range to the last network
interface defined by a net command.  A default gateway is assigned by default.
.br

.br
Example:
.br

.br
net eth0
.br
iprange 192.168.1.150,192.168.1.160
.br

.TP
\fBmac address
Assign MAC addresses to the last network interface defined by a net command.

.TP
\fBmtu number
Assign a MTU value to the last network interface defined by a net command.

.TP
\fBnet bridge_interface
Enable a new network namespace and connect it to this bridge interface.
Unless specified with option \-\-ip and \-\-defaultgw, an IP address and a default gateway will be assigned
automatically to the sandbox. The IP address is verified using ARP before assignment. The address
configured as default gateway is the bridge device IP address. Up to four \-\-net
bridge devices can be defined. Mixing bridge and macvlan devices is allowed.

.TP
\fBnet ethernet_interface|wireless_interface
Enable a new network namespace and connect it
to this ethernet interface using the standard Linux macvlan or ipvlan
driver. Unless specified with option \-\-ip and \-\-defaultgw, an
IP address and a default gateway will be assigned automatically
to the sandbox. The IP address is verified using ARP before
assignment. The address configured as default gateway is the
default gateway of the host. Up to four \-\-net devices can
be defined. Mixing bridge and macvlan devices is allowed.

.TP
\fBnet none
Enable a new, unconnected network namespace. The only interface
available in the new namespace is a new loopback interface (lo).
Use this option to deny network access to programs that don't
really need network access.

.TP
\fBnet tap_interface
Enable a new network namespace and connect it
to this ethernet tap interface using the standard Linux macvlan
driver.  If the tap interface is not configured, the sandbox
will not try to configure the interface inside the sandbox.
Please use ip, netmask and defaultgw to specify the configuration.

.TP
\fBnetfilter
If a new network namespace is created, enabled default network filter.

.TP
\fBnetfilter filename
If a new network namespace is created, enabled the network filter in filename.

.TP
\fBnetlock
Generate a custom network filter and enable it.


.TP
\fBnetmask address
Use this option when you want to assign an IP address in a new namespace and
the parent interface specified by --net is not configured. An IP address and
a default gateway address also have to be added.

.TP
\fBnetns namespace
Run the program in a named, persistent network namespace. These can
be created and configured using "ip netns".

.TP
\fBveth-name name
Use this name for the interface connected to the bridge for --net=bridge_interface commands,
instead of the default one.
