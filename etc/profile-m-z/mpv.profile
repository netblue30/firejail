# Mpv has a powerfull lua-API, some off these lua-scripts interact
# with external resources which are blocked by firejail. In such cases
# you need to allow these resources by
#  - adding additional binaries to private-bin
#  - whitelisting additional paths
#  - noblacklisting paths
#  - weaking the dbus-policy
#  - ...
#
# Often these scripts require a shell:
#include allow-bin-sh.inc
#private-bin sh
