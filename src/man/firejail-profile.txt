.TH FIREJAIL-PROFILE 5 "MONTH YEAR" "VERSION" "firejail profiles man page"
.SH NAME
profile \- Security profile file syntax for Firejail

.SH USAGE
.TP
firejail \-\-profile=filename.profile

.SH DESCRIPTION
Several command line options can be passed to the program using
profile files. Firejail chooses the profile file as follows:

\fB1.\fR If a profile file is provided by the user with \-\-profile option, the profile file is loaded.
Example:
.PP
.RS
$ firejail --profile=/home/netblue/icecat.profile icecat
.br
Reading profile /home/netblue/icecat.profile
.br
[...]
.RE

\fB2.\fR If a profile file with the same name as the application is present in ~/.config/firejail directory or
in /etc/firejail, the profile is loaded. ~/.config/firejail takes precedence over /etc/firejail. Example:
.PP
.RS
$ firejail icecat
.br
Command name #icecat#
.br
Found icecat profile in /home/netblue/.config/firejail directory
.br
Reading profile /home/netblue/.config/firejail/icecat.profile
.br
[...]
.RE

\fB3.\fR Use a default.profile file if the sandbox
is started by a regular user, or a server.profile file if the sandbox
is started by root. Firejail looks for these files in ~/.config/firejail directory, followed by /etc/firejail directory.
To disable default profile loading, use --noprofile command option. Example:
.PP
.RS
$ firejail
.br
Reading profile /etc/firejail/default.profile
.br
Parent pid 8553, child pid 8554
.br
Child process initialized
.br
[...]
.br

.br
$ firejail \-\-noprofile
.br
Parent pid 8553, child pid 8554
.br
Child process initialized
.br
[...]
.RE

.SH Scripting
Scripting commands:

.TP
\fBFile and directory names
File and directory names containing spaces are supported. The space character ' ' should not be escaped.

Example: "blacklist ~/My Virtual Machines"

.TP
\fB# this is a comment

.TP
\fBinclude other.profile
Include other.profile file.

Example: "include /etc/firejail/disable-common.inc"

The file name can be prefixed with a macro such as ${HOME} or ${CFG}.
${HOME} is expanded as user home directory, and ${CFG} is expanded as
Firejail system configuration directory - in most cases /etc/firejail or
/usr/local/etc/firejail.

Example: "include ${HOME}/myprofiles/profile1" will load "~/myprofiles/profile1" file.

Example: "include ${CFG}/firefox.profile" will load "/etc/firejail/firefox.profile" file.

System configuration files in ${CFG} are overwritten during software installation.
Persistent configuration at system level is handled in ".local" files. For every
profile file in ${CFG} directory, the user can create a corresponding .local file
storing modifications to the persistent configuration. Persistent .local files
are included at the start of regular profile files.

.TP
\fBnoblacklist file_name
If the file name matches file_name, the file will not be blacklisted in any blacklist commands that follow.

Example: "noblacklist ${HOME}/.mozilla"

.TP
\fBnowhitelist file_name
If the file name matches file_name, the file will not be whitelisted in any whitelist commands that follow.

Example: "nowhitelist ~/.config"

.TP
\fBignore
Ignore command.

Example: "ignore seccomp"
.br
Example: "ignore net ehh0"

.TP
\fBquiet
Disable Firejail's output. This should be the first uncommented command in the profile file.

Example: "quiet"

.SH Filesystem
These profile entries define a chroot filesystem built on top of the existing
host filesystem. Each line describes a file element that is removed from
the filesystem (\fBblacklist\fR), a read-only file or directory (\fBread-only\fR),
a tmpfs mounted on top of an existing directory (\fBtmpfs\fR),
or mount-bind a directory  or file on top of another directory or file (\fBbind\fR).
Use \fBprivate\fR to set private mode.
File globbing is supported, and PATH and HOME directories are searched.
Examples:
.TP
\fBblacklist file_or_directory
Blacklist directory or file. Examples:
.br

.br
blacklist /usr/bin
.br
blacklist /usr/bin/gcc*
.br
blacklist ${PATH}/ifconfig
.br
blacklist ${HOME}/.ssh

.TP
\fBblacklist-nolog file_or_directory
When --tracelog flag is set, blacklisting generates syslog messages if the sandbox tries to access the file or directory.
blacklist-nolog command disables syslog messages for this particular file or directory. Examples:
.br

.br
blacklist-nolog /usr/bin
.br
blacklist-nolog /usr/bin/gcc*

.TP
\fBbind directory1,directory2
Mount-bind directory1 on top of directory2. This option is only available when running as root.
.TP
\fBbind file1,file2
Mount-bind file1 on top of file2. This option is only available when running as root.
.TP
\fBdisable-mnt
Disable /mnt, /media, /run/mount and /run/media access.
.TP
\fBkeep-var-tmp
/var/tmp directory is untouched.
.TP
\fBmkdir directory
Create a directory in user home or under /tmp before the sandbox is started.
The directory is created if it doesn't already exist.
.br

.br
Use this command for whitelisted directories you need to preserve
when the sandbox is closed. Without it, the application will create the directory, and the directory
will be deleted when the sandbox is closed. Subdirectories are recursively created. Example from
firefox profile:
.br

.br
mkdir ~/.mozilla
.br
whitelist ~/.mozilla
.br
mkdir ~/.cache/mozilla/firefox
.br
whitelist ~/.cache/mozilla/firefox
.TP
\fBmkfile file
Similar to mkdir, this command creates a file in user home or under /tmp before the sandbox is started.
The file is created if it doesn't already exist.
.TP
\fBnoexec file_or_directory
Remount the file or the directory noexec, nodev and nosuid.
.TP
\fBprivate
Mount new /root and /home/user directories in temporary
filesystems. All modifications are discarded when the sandbox is
closed.
.TP
\fBprivate directory
Use directory as user home.
.TP
\fBprivate-cache
Mount an empty temporary filesystem on top of the .cache directory in user home. All
modifications are discarded when the sandbox is closed.
.TP
\fBprivate-dev
Create a new /dev directory. Only disc, dri, dvb, hidraw, null, full, zero, tty, pts, ptmx,
random, snd, urandom, video, log, shm and usb devices are available.
Use the options no3d, nodvd, nosound, notv, nou2f and novideo for additional restrictions.
.TP
\fBkeep-dev-shm
/dev/shm directory is untouched (even with private-dev).
.TP
\fBprivate-tmp
Mount an empty temporary filesystem on top of /tmp directory whitelisting /tmp/.X11-unix.
.TP
\fBread-only file_or_directory
Make directory or file read-only.
.TP
\fBread-write file_or_directory
Make directory or file read-write.
.TP
\fBtmpfs directory
Mount an empty tmpfs filesystem on top of directory. This option is available only when running the sandbox as root.
.TP
\fBwhitelist file_or_directory
Whitelist directory or file. A temporary file system is mounted on the top directory, and the
whitelisted files are mount-binded inside. Modifications to whitelisted files are persistent,
everything else is discarded when the sandbox is closed. The top directory could be
user home, /dev, /etc, /media, /mnt, /opt, /srv, /sys/module, /usr/share, /var, and /tmp.
.br

.br
Symbolic link handling: with the exception of user home, both the link and the real file should be in
the same top directory. For user home, both the link and the real file should be owned by the user.
.TP
\fBwritable-etc
Mount /etc directory read-write.
.TP
\fBwritable-run-user
Disable the default blacklisting of run/user/$UID/systemd and /run/user/$UID/gnupg.
.TP
\fBwritable-var
Mount /var directory read-write.
.TP
\fBwritable-var-log
Use the real /var/log directory, not a clone. By default, a tmpfs is mounted on top of /var/log
directory, and a skeleton filesystem is created based on the original /var/log.

.SH Security filters
The following security filters are currently implemented:

.TP
\fBapparmor
Enable AppArmor confinement.
.TP
\fBcaps
Enable default Linux capabilities filter.
.TP
\fBcaps.drop all
Blacklist all Linux capabilities.
.TP
\fBcaps.drop capability,capability,capability
Blacklist given Linux capabilities.
.TP
\fBcaps.keep capability,capability,capability
Whitelist given Linux capabilities.
.TP
\fBprotocol protocol1,protocol2,protocol3
Enable protocol filter. The filter is based on seccomp and  checks the
first argument to socket system call. Recognized values: \fBunix\fR,
\fBinet\fR, \fBinet6\fR, \fBnetlink\fR and \fBpacket\fR.
.TP
\fBseccomp
Enable seccomp filter and blacklist the syscalls in the default list. See man 1 firejail for more details.
.TP
\fBseccomp syscall,syscall,syscall
Enable seccomp filter and blacklist the system calls in the list on top of default seccomp filter.
.TP
\fBseccomp.block-secondary
Enable seccomp filter and filter system call architectures
so that only the native architecture is allowed.
.TP
\fBseccomp.drop syscall,syscall,syscall
Enable seccomp filter and blacklist  the system calls in the list.
.TP
\fBseccomp.keep syscall,syscall,syscall
Enable seccomp filter and whitelist the system calls in the list.
.TP
\fBmemory-deny-write-execute
Install a seccomp filter to block attempts to create memory mappings
that are both writable and executable, to change mappings to be
executable or to create executable shared memory.
.TP
\fBnonewprivs
Sets the NO_NEW_PRIVS prctl.  This ensures that child processes
cannot acquire new privileges using execve(2);  in particular,
this means that calling a suid binary (or one with file capabilities)
does not result in an increase of privilege.
.TP
\fBnoroot
Use this command  to enable an user namespace. The namespace has only one user, the current user.
There is no root account (uid 0) defined in the namespace.

configured as default gateway is the bridge device IP address. Up to four \-\-net
bridge devices can be defined. Mixing bridge and macvlan devices is allowed.

.TP
\fBnet ethernet_interface|wireless_interface
Enable a new network namespace and connect it
to this ethernet interface using the standard Linux macvlan or ipvlan
driver. Unless specified with option \-\-ip and \-\-defaultgw, an
IP address and a default gateway will be assigned automatically
to the sandbox. The IP address is verified using ARP before
assignment. The address configured as default gateway is the
default gateway of the host. Up to four \-\-net devices can
be defined. Mixing bridge and macvlan devices is allowed.

.TP
\fBnet tap_interface
Enable a new network namespace and connect it
to this ethernet tap interface using the standard Linux macvlan
driver.  If the tap interface is not configured, the sandbox
will not try to configure the interface inside the sandbox.
