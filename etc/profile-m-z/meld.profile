# Firejail profile for meld
# Description: Graphical tool to diff and merge files
# This file is overwritten after every install/update
# Persistent local customizations
include meld.local
# Persistent global definitions
include globals.local

# If you want to use meld as git mergetool (and maybe some other VCS integrations) you need
# to bypass firejail. You can do this by removing the symlink or by calling it by its absolute path.
# Removing the symlink:
# $ sudo rm /usr/local/bin/meld
# Calling it by its absolute path (example for git mergetool):
# $ git config --global mergetool.meld.cmd /usr/bin/meld
