If you make a PR for new profiles or changeing profiles please do the following:
 - [ ] The ordering of options follow the rules descripted in [/usr/share/doc/firejail/profile.template](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/blob/master/etc/templates/profile.template).
 - [ ] Order the arguments of options alphabetical, you can easy do this with `/lib64/firejail/sort.py /path/to/your/profile`.

If you have no idea how to do one of these, you can open the PR anyway.
