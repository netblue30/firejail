# Comment/uncomment the relevant include file(s) in your archiver-common.local
# to (un)restrict file access for **all** archivers. Another option is to do this **per archiver**
# in the relevant <archiver>.local. Beware that things tend to break when overtightening
# profiles. For example, because you only need to (un)compress files in ${DOWNLOADS},
# other applications may need access to ${HOME}/.local/share.
